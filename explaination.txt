This project aims to predict the level of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the air using various factors like the levels of other pollutants, temperature, humidity, and even the time of day, month, and day of the week.

Here's a breakdown:

Data Preparation: The project starts by cleaning up the data from the Air Quality dataset. This involves removing unnecessary columns, dealing with missing values (replacing them with NaN and then filling them with the median), and converting the date and time information into a format that can be used for analysis. New features like hour, month, and weekday are extracted from the date and time.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The project then explores the data by visualizing the distribution of CO levels and the relationships between different factors using a correlation heatmap. This helps understand the data before building models.

Model Building: Several machine learning models are used to predict CO levels:
Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso: These are simpler models that try to find a linear relationship between the factors and CO levels. Ridge and Lasso are variations that help prevent the model from becoming too complex.

Decision Tree: This model makes predictions by following a tree-like structure of decisions based on the input factors.

Random Forest: This model is an ensemble of multiple decision trees. It combines the predictions of many trees to get a more accurate and robust prediction.

Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics tell us how well the model's predictions match the actual CO levels.

Feature Importance: For the Random Forest model, the project also identifies which factors are most important in predicting CO levels.

Model Tuning: The Random Forest model is further optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best settings (hyperparameters) for better performance.

Model Saving: Finally, the trained Random Forest model (which performed best in this case) is saved so it can be used later to make predictions on new data without retraining.
In simple terms, the project takes air quality data, cleans it up, explores it, uses different methods (algorithms) to predict CO levels based on other factors, checks how good these predictions are, finds out which factors are most influential, fine-tunes the best prediction method, and saves it for future use.
